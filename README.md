This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This application allows user to paste their amazon link in and track the price, the website would return the current price and the original price, also highest, lowest one and price history, etc

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project hasn't been deployed as I haven't find a perfect deploy website that allows project which include client and server in the same folder and my Git was blocked from Vercel and I don't know why
